                <h2>General History</h2>
                <p>C# was created by a Danish software engineer named Anders Hejlsberg working at Microsoft in 2000. 
                    C# is a <strong>modern, multi-purpose, object-oriented programming language</strong> mainly used mobile apps, 
                    desktop apps, cloud-based services, websites, enterprise software and games. 
                    Its versatility allows it to be used for much more, being one of the most popular languages out there. 
                    C# integrates seamlessly with a game engine called Unity used to develop lots of games. 
                    Behind the scenes, every C# program runs through the Microsoft .NET framework, 
                    which justifies using this language for applications and programs for the architecture of the Microsoft platform.
